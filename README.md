## NYX_CONFIG

I'm currently in the process of switching my systems to NixOS. 

This repo is probably far from the textbook example of how one could (or perhaps should) setup their Nix configs, but this is part of the learning process. Most importantly, though, while it works for me right now, this repo is far from finished.

So, bottom line: Use it as inspiration, but don't use it for production.
